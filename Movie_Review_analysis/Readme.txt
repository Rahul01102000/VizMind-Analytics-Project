🎬 Movie Review Analysis
📌 Project Overview

The Movie Review Analysis project is a data analytics project that explores and analyzes movie rating data from users. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights about movies, users, and their preferences.

This project demonstrates practical data analytics skills, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
